  <h3>
    Halloween’s roots stretch back over two millennia to the Celtic festival of Samhain. Celebrated on October 31st, it marked the end of the harvest and the start of winter, a time when the veil between the living and the dead was believed to be thin. Over time, Christian traditions blended in, transforming Samhain into All Hallows’ Eve, and eventually, Halloween. What began as a spiritual observance evolved into a global celebration for children to have tons of fun and candy.
