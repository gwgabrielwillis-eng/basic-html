    <h3>
        Today’s Halloween is a mix of old customs and modern fun. Trick-or-treating has its origins in medieval “souling,” where people went door-to-door offering prayers in exchange for food. Costumes, once meant to scare off spirits, now reflect everything from classic monsters to pop culture icons. And pumpkin carving? That started with turnips in Ireland, pumpkins took over when the tradition crossed into North America.
